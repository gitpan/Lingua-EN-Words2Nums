* spelled out numbers, ie, "nine one one" => 911,
	(currently, it returns 9 + 1 + 1)
	(getting this right is a pre-req for decimals..)
* fractions and decimals
* support strings that start with a number and end with non-numbers,
  returning the remaining part. HARD -- numbers are currently parsed
  backwards!
